It takes a target object and one or more source object. It modifies the target object with several usages listed below. Source objects are never modified.</p>\n<h3>Usage 1: Copying enumerable properties</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/96e854200a56b733fb462ed0f7fb92b6/demo1.js\">code</a></p>\n<p>Let’s see the usage of this method from some examples:</p>\n<p>As we can see, the variable <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> has an enumerable property a which is equal to 5. By doing an <code class=\"language-text\">Object.assign(y, x)</code> those enumerable properties of <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> will be copied to <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>. The copied object will be returned by this method.</p>\n<h3>Usage 2: Overwriting common enumerable properties</h3>\n<p>Common properties of the target object will be overridden by values in source objects. Let’s see the usage of this method from some examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/79453c6ee35ac4addd18a2ae4b264288/demo2.js\">code</a></p>\n<p>As we can see, the variable <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> have common property a. By doing an <code class=\"language-text\">Object.assign(y, x)</code> the common enumerable properties of the target get overridden by that of the source.</p>\n<h3>Usage 3: Merging objects</h3>\n<p>This method can also be used to create new objects by merging two or more variables. For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/a5bc7875b104d8ab64a57a225e15b7fb/demo3.js\">code</a></p>\n<p>Although there is nothing different in the working on this method in this example, if you see it from the perspective of utility, you can use this method for merging multiple objects in one object. Here we are merging y, z, v, into a target object x.\nObject.assign() is very important method finding it’s usage at various places.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Object.assign() in JavaScript","date":"December 24, 2019","description":"OBJECT Assign"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Object.assign()-in-JavaScript/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/The Problem of Pending Cases in Indian Courts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Problem of Pending Cases in Indian Courts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/books-i-read-in-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Books I read in 2019"}}}}}
